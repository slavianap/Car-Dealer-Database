A new class of objects is written to represent car entries. A database entry consists of the Manufacturer, Brand, Model, Registration Number, Price and Colour. The class definition includes an appropriate constructor method. A single entry can be entered by the user typing the details in and the entry can be printed out. The program stores an array of car objects, where each entry in the array is a single object describing an item. Furthermore, the menu of options is included.
